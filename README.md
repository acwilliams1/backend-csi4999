NodeJS,  ExpressJS, and SQL query backend code for Android/Fitbit Application

My most proud achievement in my career so far is working with the company sponsor "Crossfit in the D", for the senior capstone project at university. 

The client needed a fitbit/android application, complete with a frontend and backend server. The purpose of the app was to manage and record an exercise program for chemotherapy patients. 

In a team of 5, I was solely responsible for the backend server, database hosting, API, and API documentation. 

~ Created Backend server written in Javascript, with frameworks NodeJS and Express JS (for the API). 
~ Planned and created mySQL database to hold all application information needed; Account info, urls, application info, exercise data, visual graph data, and more. 
~ Hosted API , server, and database on the Google Cloud Platform, managing and tracking errors and logs.
